						<p class="descriptions">The Public Relations committee is in charge of keeping SWE members in the loop about SWE events and opportunities. The main ways in which we do this are through preparing and distributing the weekly SWEmail, producing the newsletter that is distributed at general meetings, flyering around campus, chalking messages in classrooms, and posting social media updates including Facebook. If you have a passion for writing, design, communications/social media, or just an interest in public relations then we would love to have you join our team! </p>

Project proposals may be submitted during the fall semester after which teams may begin their work. The final report is due at the end of the spring semester, and the presentations occur at the SWE fall conference.</p>

						<p class="descriptions">Engineering Day is a fun event in October for K-3rd graders, and this year it will be on October 27th, 10 AM - 1 PM. There will be numerous booths featuring different hands-on activities that the students are able to try out for themselves. It is a fun opportunity for students to explore science and engineering concepts with a fun Halloween theme! Around 100 students are expected, as well as their chaperones, and they’ll be able to wander around, trying out the different activities in a casual, carnival style. We are hoping to have 10 booths with two chairs each to lead the participants and their parents through the activity, so please volunteer! Chairs will need to be present for the whole event (October 27th, 10 AM - 1 PM) and free lunch will be provided! We are also looking for people to help with planning the event, dealing with more of the logistical side. </p>
